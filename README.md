# PreWork Follow-up | Ironhack Fullstack Application

## Global information

### Directory structure
```
client/
  build/
  node_modules/
  public/
  src/
  package.json
server/
  bin/
  configs/
  models/
  public/
  routes/
  package.json
package.json
```

## Commands

**To install all the packages**
```sh
$ npm install
# OR
$ (cd server && npm install)
$ (cd client && npm install)
```

**To install a package for the server**
```sh
$ cd server
$ npm install --save axios
```

**To install a package for the client**
```sh
$ cd client
$ npm install --save axios
```

**To run the server and the client**
```sh
# Open a first terminal
$ npm run dev:server
# Run the server on http://localhost:3030/

# Open a second terminal
$ npm run dev:client
# Run the client on http://localhost:3000/
```

So now you can go to 
- http://localhost:3030/api/: A simple API call
- http://localhost:3030/: The website based on client/build (that you can update with `$ (cd client && npm run build)`)
- http://localhost:3000/: The last version of your React application that is calling your API with the base url "http://localhost:3030/api/"


##Â Example in the code

### `server/routes/auth.js`

- `router.post('/signup')`: Route to create a new user
- `router.post('/login')`: Route to send the user JWT 
- `router.get('/secret')`: Route where the user need to be authenticated


### `server/routes/users.js`

- `router.get('/')`: Route to get all users
- `router.post('/picture-one-user')`: Route to add a picture on one user with Cloudinary

<!-- TODO: give instructions for Cloudinary -->
<!-- TODO: give instructions for route guards -->

### `server/routes/countries.js`

- `router.get('/')`: Route to get all countries
- `router.get('/static-sample')`: Route to get a static sample of countries
- `router.post('/')`: Route to add a country



## Deployement on Heroku

### To deploy the first time

Create a project on Heroku.com. Here for the demo I named the project "my-ironhack-project". 

Then, you need to link your Git project with Heroku.

```sh
# Replace "my-ironhack-project" by the name of your Heroku project
$ heroku git:remote -a my-ironhack-project 
$ git push heroku master
```

Then you need to create a Mongo database online with MLab.

```sh
$ heroku addons:create mongolab:sandbox
```


### To redeploy

You just need to push on `heroku` (don't forget to commit before):
```sh
$ git push heroku master
```

### To execute a seed

If you want to execute something on the server, for example a seed, you can use `heroku run`.

Example:
```
$ heroku run node server/bin/seeds/seeds.js
```


### To Open MongoLab

You can either go on the Heroku project page ("Overview" tab) or type the following commad:

```
$ heroku addons:open mongolab
```


### See the logs

```sh
$ heroku logs
```

## Notes about the Mern boilerplate
- Add instructions to clone properly the project
- Probably include the `package-lock.json` file
- At `client/src/api.js`, in `loadUser`, we should just have `if (user.token) {`
